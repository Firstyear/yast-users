Users module Todo
-----------------

NIS:
- edit fields
    - adding users to local groups [done]
    - others currently not possible on client (yp-tools are interactive)
- add/delete (server only) [done]

LDAP:
- show users [done] 
    - necessary conditions:
        - perl-ldap installed
        - anonymous read access to LDAP server 
            (-> should be configured by default in LDAP-server module?)
- edit fields
    - adding users to local groups (=local change) [done]
- add/delete (server)
- add/delete (client)
    - same actions on client and server
    - requires correctly configured cpu (/etc/cpu.cfg)
    - add user [done]
        - creating home directory only on server [done]
    - delete user [done]
        - removing home directory only on server [done]
    - edit user
        - password changing is strange
        - changing homedir only on server [done]

- dialog for definition of query to ldapsearch

Kerberos:
- show users
    - requires read/list access, defined on Kerberos server
        ( -> we first should have some Kerberos server setting [module?])
- edit fields (password only)
    - password changing utilities are interactive
- basic client configuration [done]

Expert login dialog (during installation):
- running LDAP, NIS, Kerberos configuration [done]

- better workflow (some checkboxes?)
