Users module Todo
-----------------

NIS:
- edit fields on client
    - problem: all tools are interactive

LDAP:
- show users without need of anonymous access
- edit password
    - problem: doesn't work with cpu

- adding users to LDAP groups

- propose configuration of /etc/cpu.cfg

- dialog for definition query filter

Kerberos:

- edit password 
    - problem: password changing utilities are interactive

Expert login dialog (authentication):

- better workflow (some checkboxes?)

- other values for pam/nsswitch (krb5 - required?)

Dialogs behaviour:

- groups and users summary to one dialog
